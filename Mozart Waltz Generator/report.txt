3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz): No issues encountered. I solved this problem
   by making a table of minuets and a table of trios using stdarray.create2D() and
   nested for loops. The tables contained the measures I got from standard input. Thus,
   I used two for loops, one to write 16 minuet measures and the other to write 16 trios
   measures. In each for loop I used the stdrandom.uniformInt() to get a random
   index of row in order to get the value of measures from each column of 16
   sequences.



   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz): To solve this problem, first I created a 1D list
   with the waltz measures from standard input. Then I used if statements and
   for loops to write the input error messages according to the project writeup.
   Afterwards, I used stdaudio.playFile() to play the minuets and trios measures, but
   then I came across some issues on how to write the value of filename. Therefore, I
   asked for help in Piazza and my instructor helped me debug this problem.
   I later ran my code and found another issue -- I wasn't getting any output. I solved
   this issue by making some changes on my VM audio settings, and was able to hear the
   output.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I enjoyed doing this assignment. It was challenging and interesting.
   I believe this project was easier than the last one. However, I still learned
   a lot from it. Things I enjoyed learning was: how to use stdaudio module,
   how to create 1D and 2D arrays, and how to better use for loops.
   I had a lot of fun doing this project, and I am looking forward to the next one.
