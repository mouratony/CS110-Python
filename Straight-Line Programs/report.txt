3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Day of the Week): I didn't find any issues doing this problem.
   I solved it using the given equations.

   Problem 2 (Mercator Projection): I didn't find any error.
   To solve this problem I used the order of operations PEMDAS.
 
   Problem 3 (Great Circle Distance): I approached this problem by separating
   the math expression into different variables. Thus, there's less chance to miscalculate.

   Problem 4 (Wind Chill): I followed the math order of operations and the given
   expression to calculate the value of wind chill.

   Problem 5 (Gravitational Force): To solve this problem, I used the provided
   expression in order to find the value of the gravitational force(F).

   Problem 6 (Snell's Law): I found an issue with the expression to calculate
   theta2, because it was missing one of the decimals. To solve it,
   I divided the indexes of refraction, and then
   multiplied by sin(theta1).

   Problem 7 (Gambler's Ruin): I didn't find any SyntaxErrors.
   I followed the math order of operation rules.

   Problem 8 (Waiting Time): No issue found. I used the math
   module.

   Problem 9 (Die Roll): I had no issue. I solved it by using
   the stdrandom.randomInt function.

   Problem 10 (Three Sort): I found it quite time consuming to find
   the arithmetic combination in order to get n (the middle value).
   I solved it by calculating the sum of those three integers taken
   from the command line, and subtracting them by the min and max value.
