# CS110-Python
A compilation of all my CS110 projects utilizing the Python programming language.


### Atomic Nature of Matter
In this project, we were tasked with replicating Perrin's experiment using advanced video and computer technology to accurately measure and track the Brownian motion of particles. We were supplied with video microscopy data of polystyrene spheres suspended in water, and our role was to utilize our programming abilities to analyze the data, determine the motion of each bead between observations, correlate the data to Einstein's model, and ultimately calculate Avogadro's constant.
