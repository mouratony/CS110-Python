# CS110-Python
A compilation of all my CS110 projects utilizing the Python programming language.


### Atomic Nature of Matter
In this project, we were tasked with replicating Perrin's experiment using advanced video and computer technology to accurately measure and track the Brownian motion of particles. We were supplied with video microscopy data of polystyrene spheres suspended in water, and our role was to utilize our programming abilities to analyze the data, determine the motion of each bead between observations, correlate the data to Einstein's model, and ultimately calculate Avogadro's constant.

### Markov Model
In this project, we employed a Markov chain to develop a statistical model of English text, and then utilized the model to generate stylized pseudo-random text and decode messages with noise.

### Mozart Waltz Generator
In this project, we were required to develop a program that creates a two-part waltz by randomly piecing together 32 of 272 pre-composed musical elements, and another program to play the generated waltz.

### Programs with Control Flow
The goal of this project was to utilize control flow structures such as if-else statements, for loops, and while loops to manipulate program execution based on specified conditions.

### RSA Cryptosystem
This project required the implementation of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) public-key cryptosystem, a widely used method for secure communication in various technologies such as browsers, ATM machines, and mobile devices. The RSA algorithm relies on the manipulation of large integers, which was accomplished using the int data type in Python. The objective was to create a library that supported the core functions needed to develop the RSA cryptosystem and to implement programs for encrypting and decrypting messages using RSA.

### Straight-Line Programs
The objective of this project was to create a program that follows a linear execution path, in which instructions are executed in a predetermined sequence, to accomplish a series of specific, straightforward tasks such as mathematical operations, displaying text or inputting data from the user.
